This repository contains my code for all assignments in the MOOC course [Machine Learning: Regression](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression/home/welcome) offered on Coursera and instructed by [Emily Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ebfox/) and [Carlos Guestrin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/) of University of Washington.

As part of University of Washington's Machine Learning Specialization, the course covers the following topics:
